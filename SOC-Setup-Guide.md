# üöÄ SOC Home Lab Setup Guide

## üìå Overview
* This SOC home lab is designed to simulate real-world security monitoring using:
* SIEM (Graylog) for log collection & correlation
* EDR (OSSEC) for endpoint monitoring
* IDS (Suricata) for intrusion detection
* Firewall (pfSense) for network segmentation
* Kali Linux for cyberattack simulations
* Incident Response (TheHive - Planned)

## üìå Step-by-Step Installation & Configuration
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Installing Graylog (SIEM) on VMware**

üîπ Why VMware?

Graylog requires **MongoDB**, which has CPU conflicts with VirtualBox.

Download and install Ubuntu-22.04.5-desktop on VMware
[Ubuntu 22.04.5 desktop version](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/ubuntu-22.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso)

üìå Installation Steps
```sh
# Update the Ubuntu system
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```
