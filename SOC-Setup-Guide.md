## üìå Step-by-Step Installation & Configuration
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Installing Graylog (SIEM) on VMware**

üîπ Why VMware?

Graylog requires **MongoDB**, which has CPU conflicts with VirtualBox.

Download and install Ubuntu-22.04.5-desktop on VMware
[Ubuntu 22.04.5 desktop version](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/ubuntu-22.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso)

## üìå  Installation Steps:
 ### Update the Ubuntu system
```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```
### Install dependencies
```sh
sudo apt-get install gnupg curl
```
### Import mongodb key
```sh
curl -fsSL https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-6.0.asc | \
   sudo gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg \
   --dearmor
```
### Create the repository
```sh
echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/6.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-6.0.list
```
### Update the package database
```sh
sudo apt-get update
```
### Install MongoDB
```sh
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
```
### Enable, start and check the status of the service
```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable mongod.service
sudo systemctl start mongod.service
sudo systemctl status mongod.service
```
MongoDB should be running and active
### To avoid auto update of the MongoDB, use the command
```sh
sudo apt-mark hold mongodb-org
```
### Install Graylog DataNode. 
Data Node is a Graylog management tool for OpenSearch. This means you don't need to install OpenSearch separately for Graylog to manage logs properly.
```sh
wget https://packages.graylog2.org/repo/packages/graylog-6.1-repository_latest.deb
sudo dpkg -i graylog-6.1-repository_latest.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install graylog-datanode
```
### As displayed, the Linux setting vm.max_map_count needs to be set
```sh
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
echo "vm.max_map_count = 262144" | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-graylog-datanode.conf
```
### Set The Password Secret
```sh
sudo sed -i "/^password_secret =/s/$/ $(< /dev/urandom tr -dc A-Z-a-z-0-9 | head -c${1:-96})/" /etc/graylog/datanode/datanode.conf
```
### Confirm the password_secret is set (You can open a new terminal Window for this. Leave this new Window opened or you can just copy the password_secret to your notepad)
```sh
grep password_secret /etc/graylog/datanode/datanode.conf
```
If you opened a new terminal Window for the previous step, return to the terminal window you've been using since the beginning. 
### Now let's enable and start the Graylog DataNode Service
```sh
sudo systemctl enable graylog-datanode.service
sudo systemctl start graylog-datanode
sudo systemctl status graylog-datanode.service
```
Data Node should be running and active
### Now, let's install the Graylog server
```sh
sudo apt-get install graylog-server
```
### Set admin password (The admin password you will set here is the password you will use to log into your Graylog web UI)
```sh
echo -n "Enter Password: " && head -1 </dev/stdin | tr -d '\n' | sha256sum | cut -d" " -f1
```
Copy the hash that is generated
### Modify the Graylog configurations file
```sh
sudo nano /etc/graylog/server/server.conf
```
Look for the root_password_sha2 = paste the admin password hash you copied here.
Go to your notepad, or if you didn't close the other terminal Window that has the password_secret, copy it. Then, on the server.conf file, look for the section password_secret = paste the password_secret here.
You can configure the time zone Graylog will use to your preference. To do this in the conf file, look for the #root_timezone = UTC. By default it is set to UTC, uncomment this by removing the #, then set the time zone to what you want. There is a link provided in the conf file that contains all the supported time zone formats. e.g., root_timezone = Africa/Lagos to set the time to Nigeria's time.
Next, change the http_bind_address to your Ubuntu machine IP address ( use "ip a" in a terminal window to check your machine's IP address ). Leave the port as:9000
Press ctrl+x then y and press Enter to save and exit the config file.
### Enable and start Graylog server
```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable graylog-server.service
sudo systemctl start graylog-server.service
sudo systemctl status graylog-server.service
```
### Setup additional information for the data node
```sh
tail -f /var/log/graylog-server/server.log
```
A URL will be provided as part of the output, click on it and begin the data node configuration as follows:
1. Configure the CA: Set the organization's name to "graylog_lab" without the quotation mark. Click to create CA.
2. Set the renewal policy as you see fit: I set it to be automatic and the certificate lifetime as 30 days.
3. Click to create policy and on the next page click to begin provisioning.
4. Once the provisioning is done, click to resume startup.
Now, your Graylog and data node should be running successfully. Log in with the username "admin" and the admin password you created during the installation steps.

```powershell
notepad sidecar.yml
```
2. Modify these lines:
```yaml
server_url: "http://<GRAYLOG_IP>:9000/api/"
server_api_token: "<YOUR_GRAYLOG_API_TOKEN>"
node_id: "windows-client"
```
* Replace <Graylog_IP> with the IP address of your Graylog server.
* Replace <YOUR_GRAYLOG_API_TOKEN> with an API token from Graylog. Follow the steps below to get an API token from Graylog:
 * In the Graylog web UI, select **system**
 * Select **Sidecars**
 * CLick **Create Token**
3. Save the file and exit.
4. Restart the Sidecar service:
```powershell
Restart-Service graylog-sidecar
```
### Configure Sidecar in Graylog Web UI
1. Log into Graylog Web UI (http://<GRAYLOG_IP>:9000).
2. Go to: **System > Sidecars**.
3. You should see your Windows machine listed. ‚úÖ
4. Click "**Configuration**" next to the Windows client.
5. Select "**Winlogbeat**" as the Collector Backend.
6. Click "**Assign**".
### Configure Winlogbeat in Sidecar
1. Go to System > Sidecars > Configuration.
2. Click Create New Configuration.
3. Set the following settings:
 * Name: *Windows Logs*

 * **Configuration**: Edit the **output.logstash:
   hosts: ["${user.graylog_host}:5044"]** to **output.logstash:
   hosts: ["<GRAYLOG_IP>:5044"]**
You can also remove logs that you don't want to be collected to reduce the number of logs to be monitored and collected.
4. Click **save**
### Step 4: Start Sending Logs
1. Go back to **System > Sidecars**.
2. Click "**Restart**" next to your Windows client.
3. After a few minutes, logs should appear in **Graylog > Search**
### Verify Logs in Graylog
* Go to **Graylog Web UI > Search**.
* Use this query:
```bash
source:windows-client-name
```
You should start seeing logs from your **Windows Target Machine**
### Step 2: Install and Configure Graylog Sidecar on Ubuntu
### Download & Install Sidecar
1. Download Graylog Sidecar from [Graylog Sidecar GitHub Release](https://github.com/Graylog2/collector-sidecar/releases)

Find and update these lines:
```yaml
server_url: "http://<GRAYLOG_IP>:9000/api/"
server_api_token: "<YOUR_GRAYLOG_API_TOKEN>"
node_id: "ubuntu-client"
```
* Input your Graylog server IP address.
* Follow the same steps as Windows to get a Graylog API Token for the Ubuntu.
* Save and exit (CTRL+X, then Y, then ENTER).
### Start the Sidecar Service
```bash
sudo systemctl enable graylog-sidecar
sudo systemctl start graylog-sidecar
sudo systemctl status graylo-sidecar
```
Now, you might run into an error like this :
**Failed to enable unit: Unit file graylog-sidecar.service does not exist.
Failed to start graylog-sidecar.service: Unit graylog-sidecar.service not found.**
This error can be because Graylog Sidecar service is missing or not installed correctly.
To fix this error, do the following:
#### Verify Installation: Make sure your installation is successful
```bash
dpkg -l | grep graylog-sidecar
```
* If it shows an output, the sidecar is installed successfully
* If there's no output, the sidecar isn't installed properly and you will need to install it again.
#### Check If the Service Exists
```bash
ls -l /etc/systemd/system/graylog-sidecar.service
```
* If the service exist, try reloading systemd
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
Then, start the sidecar again
* If the file does NOT exist, it means the Sidecar service file is missing. Follow these steps to manually create the service
Create the service:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/graylog-sidecar.service
```
Paste the following inside the file:
```ini
[Unit]

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up OSSEC (EDR) on VirtualBox
Download and install Ubuntu-22.04.5-server on VirtualBox
[Ubuntu 22.04.5 server version](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/ubuntu-22.04.5-live-server-amd64.iso)
# Step 1: Download and install OSSEC server
## üìå  Installation Steps:
For ease of use, ssh into the machine on a desktop Operating System (Windows or Linux). This will allow you to copy and paste commands easily.
 ### Update the Ubuntu system
```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```
### Install Required Dependencies
```sh
sudo apt install -y curl unzip make gcc policycoreutils python3 python3-pip inotify-tools
```
### Additional Dependencies
```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y \
    curl unzip make gcc policycoreutils python3 python3-pip \
    inotify-tools libpcre2-dev libssl-dev libevent-dev \
    build-essential zlib1g-dev libz-dev libsystemd-dev \
    libcap-ng-dev
```
### Download OSSEC Source Code
```sh
curl -O https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/archive/refs/tags/3.7.0.tar.gz
```
### Extract the Downloaded File
```sh
tar -xvzf 3.7.0.tar.gz
cd ossec-hids-3.7.0
```
### Start the OSSEC Installer
```sh
Start the OSSEC Installer
```
* When prompted, select: server mode.
* Enter the IP of your Ubuntu server machine as the OSSEC server IP.
* Accept default options unless you have a specific reason to change them.
### Start the OSSEC Service
```sh
sudo /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control start
```
### Check the Status of the OSSEC Service
```sh
sudo /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control status
```
**Note:** A problem I ran into was the OSSEC remote-d not running. OSSEC remote-d allows OSSEC agents to communicate with OSSEC server. Here are some fixes for the problem:
### Manually start the remote-d
```sh
sudo /var/ossec/bin/ossec-remoted -d
```
Then check the status of the OSSEC server again
### Stop and start the OSSEC server again
```sh
sudo /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control stop
sudo /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control start
```
If none of these fixes work for you, go ahead to install and register the agents. Sometimes, OSSEC remote-d fails because there are no agents registered on its list of allowed IPs.
# Step 2: Install OSSEC Agents on Target Machines
